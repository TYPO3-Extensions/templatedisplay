Introduction
Templatedisplay is a kind of "mappable" template engine for TYPO3. The extension is part of the Tesseract extensions family and deals with rendering content onto the Frontend.
In short words, it enables to do a mapping between markers and databases fields. A marker is a pattern that will be replaced dynamically by a value coming from the database. This value can be formatted according to some TypoScript configuration. It is also possible to incorporate user defined markers within a hook.
Templatedisplay is well designed for rendering lists with advanced features like sorting, filtering, page browsing. It offers a simple syntax for looping on record set, testing condition, counting records.
Screenshots
This is basically the default view where it is possible to map any markers to a database's field. The mapping is done by
1. clicking on a marker (e.g. ###FIELD.title###),
2. selecting a field in the drop-down menu,
3. selecting a type within the list,
4. adding some possible additional configuration,
5. clicking the "save field configuration" button.
By using the name of the marker, Templatedisplay will tries to identify the field in the dropdown menu "Fields". If the correspondence fails, the filed must be selected manually in the drop-down menu.
 



Questions?
If you have any questions about this extension, you may want to refer to the Tesseract Project web site (http://www.typo3-tesseract.com/) for support and tutorials. You may also ask questions in the TYPO3 English mailing list (typo3.english).
Keeping the developer happy
If you like this extension, do not hesitate to rate it. Go the Extension Repository, search for this extension, click on its title to go to the details view, then click on the “Ratings” tab and vote (you need to be logged in). Every new vote keeps the developer ticking. So just do it!
You may also take a step back and reflect about the beauty of sharing. Think about how much you are benefiting and how much yourself is giving back to the community.
Installation
Extension "templatedisplay" is part of the Tesseract framework. It will not do anything if installed alone.
After installation you must load the static TypoScript template for proper rendering.
Templatedisplay can easily display a page browser, but this requires extension "pagebrowse" to be installed too.
Requirements
Extension "templatedisplay" requires the PHP Simple XML library.
Upgrading
Please read the sections below carefully to know if you are impacted by changes in some versions.
Upgrading to 1.3.0
In version 1.3.0, the static TypoScript setup was changed to use a reference to lib.parseFunc_RTE, instead of making a copy. This was made so that plugin.tx_templatedisplay.richtext.parseFunc stays in sync with  lib.parseFunc_RTE. The drawback is that you cannot make changes like:
plugin.tx_templatedisplay.richtext.parseFunc.foo = bar

anymore. If you did such changes before, you should first override the reference by a copy and make your change again, e.g.
plugin.tx_templatedisplay.richtext.parseFunc >
plugin.tx_templatedisplay.richtext.parseFunc < lib.parseFunc_RTE
plugin.tx_templatedisplay.richtext.parseFunc.foo = bar


Configuration
HTML Template setup
HTML Template can be defined of two manners.
insert inline HTM directly in the text box
external file loaded with following syntax: FILE:fileadmin/templates/plugins/tesseract/news/list_of_news.html
External files would have the benefit to make use of an external editor which is more convenient when editing large templates
Element types
There are various elements types that can be chosen according to your needs:

Type
Description
TypoScript Object / function
Default parameters
Raw text
This will display the data from the database field as is, without any transformation. Use this whenever possible, as it gives much better performance.
-

Text
The local TypoScript is the same as for Object TEXT. The value of the TEXT object will be loaded with the value from the mapped database field.
TEXT

Rich text
This is actually the same as the “Text”-type element, but it is designed to handle fields that use the RTE. Such fields need special rendering, so that RTE data is interpreted before display in the front-end. As this is not necessary with every text field, a separate element type exists.
TEXT

Image
The value from the database field will be automatically stored in the “file” property of the object.
IMAGE
altText = file_name
titleText = file_name
Image Resource
Returns only the image-reference, possibly wrapped with stdWrap. The value from the database field will be automatically stored in the “file” property of the object.
IMG_RESOURCE

Media
Uses the MEDIA content object for rendering, so it can be used for displaying video or audio files. The value from the database field is used automatically for the "file" property.
MEDIA
type = video
renderType = auto
Records
Will render records using the TypoScript RECORDS object. The value is expected to be a uid or have the structure "tablename_uid" (e.g. tt_content_38). The mapped value is automatically stored in the "source" property of the object.
RECORDS

URL to detail
This is designed to create a link and corresponds to the typolink TS function. It is automatically loaded with a configuration to create a link to a detail view as expected by the Display Controller (extension: displaycontroller). It is also configured to return only the URL, but this can be overridden in the local TS. 
The value from the database field will be automatically stored in the “additionalParams” property of the object.
typolink
useCacheHash = 1
returnLast = url
additionalParams = &tx_displaycontroller[table]=xyz&tx_displaycontrolle[showUid]=$value
URL to page
It should be used only for database fields who contain page id's, as it will create a link to said page. The value from the database field will be automatically stored in the “parameter” property of the object.
typolink
returnLast = url
useCacheHash = 1
URL to file
Meant for links to files. The value from the database field will be automatically stored in the “parameter” property of the object.
typolink
returnLast = url
useCacheHash = 1
Email
Meant  for emails. The value from the database field will be automatically stored in the “parameter” property of the object.
typolink

User function
It is preconfigured with a property called “parameter” which will contain the value from the database field. The value from the database field will be automatically stored in the “parameter” property of the object.
USER


List of available markers
Content markers
Name
Description
###FIELD.myField###
This is the most common marker that deals with content of the database. When possible, try to make correspond the name of the marker with the name of the field. Templatedisplay will be able to guess automatically the mapping. Click on it to start the mapping process.

###OBJECT.myValue###
Attach some TypoScript to this marker. Same configuration options than FIELD markers but no field associated with.
###LABEL.myField###
The label of the field is translated according to the language of the website. To have a correct translation, the LABEL must have a proper TCA.
###LLL:EXT:myExtension/locallang.xml:myKey###
When no TCA is provided or an external string must be translated, use this syntax for translating a chain of character.
###EXPRESSION.key:var1|var2###
Calls on the expression parser of extension “expressions” to resolve any well-formed expression.
Example:
###EXPRESSION.gp:clear_cache###

will retrieve the value of a GET/POST variable called “clear_cache”.
###FILTER.myTable.myField###
Value of a filter. MyTable is optional and depend of the filter naming.
###SORT.sort###
Value of the sort. The most probably a field name.
###SORT.order###
Value of the order. Can be "ASC" or "DESC"
###SESSION.sessionName.order###
Access information stored in the session.
###COUNTER###
The counter is automatically incremented by 1. This syntax makes sense inside  a LOOP and can be used for styling odd / even rows of a table for example. The syntax may looks like this:
<!--IF(###COUNTER### % 2 == 0)-->class="even"<!--ELSE-->class="odd"<!--ENDIF-->

In the case of a LOOP in a LOOP the second COUNTER remains independent.
<!--LOOP(pages)-->
  <div>counter 1 : ###COUNTER###</div>
  <!--LOOP(tt_content)-->
    <div>counter 2 : ###COUNTER###</div>
  <!--ENDLOOP-->
<!--ENDLOOP-->
###COUNTER(loop_name)###
This kind of counter is handy in case of LOOP in a LOOP. Let's assume, we need to access the value of the parent COUNTER in a child's LOOP. 
<!--LOOP(pages)-->
  <div>Some value</div>
  <!--LOOP(tt_content)-->
    <div>counter pages: ###COUNTER(pages)###</div>
  <!--ENDLOOP-->
<!--ENDLOOP-->
###PAGE_BROWSER###
If extension "pagebrowse" is installed and correctly loaded, displays a universal page browser. Other page browsers are possible but must be handled with a Hook.
###RECORD(tt_content, 12)###
Call in the template it self an external record. Very handy for including records in a records.
###HOOK.myHook###
See section Hooks
###TOTAL_RECORDS###
Returns the total number in the main of records without considering a possible limit. To have a glimpse on  the data structure, add the parameter "debug[structure]" in the URL. The value ###TOTAL_RECORDS### corresponds to the cell "totalCount" of the main structure (level 1). Make sure you have a backend login to see the table.
###SUBTOTAL_RECORDS###
Returns the total of records in the main data structure considering a possible limit. To have a glimpse on  the data structure, add the parameter "debug[structure]" in the URL. The value ###SUBTOTAL_RECORDS### corresponds to the cell "count" of the main structure (level 1). Make sure you have a backend login to see the table.
###TOTAL_RECORDS(tablename)###
Returns the total of records corresponding to a table name without considering a possible limit.
###SUBTOTAL_RECORDS(tablename)###
Returns the total of records corresponding to a table name considering a possible limit.
###RECORD_OFFSET###
Return the page offset. The page offset corresponds to the current position inside a global record set. This marker is useful when displaying a page browser. See marker ###PAGE_BROWSER###. You can have something like this: ###RECORD_OFFSET### / ###TOTAL_RECORDS### which will display the current position among the total number of records. 
###START_AT###
Return the position of the first record returned by a subset, considering a possible limit.
This marker is useful when displaying a page browser like this one :
Records 1 – 10 of 2000 in total

which would be coded like this in the template:
Records ###START_AT### – ###STOP_AT### of ###TOTAL_RECORDS### in total
###STOP_AT###
Return the position of the last record returned by a subset, considering a possible limit.
See ###START_AT### above.
Structure Markers
Name
Description
<!--LOOP(loop_name)-->
<!--ENDLOOP-->
Where loop_name is a table name.
<!--IF(###FIELD.maker### == 'value')-->
<!--ENDIF-->
Allows to display conditional content. Be careful to use parentheses around the condition.

Warning: it is not possible to nest IF markers.
<!--EMPTY-->
<!--ENDEMPTY-->
This part is displayed only if the Data Structure is empty. Please mind that the rest of the template is still displayed.
Functions
Name
Description
FUNCTION:php_function("###MARKER###",parameter1,...)
A PHP function. No simple / double quote required.
Examples:
FUNCTION:str_replace(P ,X, ###LABEL.title###)
FUNCTION:str_repeat(###LABEL.title###,2)
FUNCTION:md5(###LABEL.title###)
LIMIT(###MARKER###, 4)
Limit the number of words in a marker
E.g.
LIMIT(###FIELD.description###, 4) will return the first 4 words of field description
COUNT(tableName)
Return the number of records from the Data Structure. Add parameter debug[structure] in the URL to see the Data Structure. (Works with a BE login)
E.g.
COUNT(tt_content) will return the number of records in table tt_content
PAGE_STATUS(404)
PAGE_STATUS(404, page/404/) 
PAGE_STATUS(301, new/page/)
If the Data Structure is empty, send the appropriate header and redirect link when needed.

For the 404 status, leaving the redirect URL empty will make it fall back on the internal page not found handling of TYPO3.


TypoScript configuration
Default rendering
A default rendering can be defined for each element type. The static template provided with the extension contains the following:
plugin.tx_templatedisplay {
	defaultRendering {
		richtext.parseFunc < lib.parseFunc_RTE
	}
}

This configuration copies the RTE parseFunc into the parseFunc for the rich text-type element, making possible to render correctly RTE-enabled fields. Here's an example configuration:
plugin.tx_templatedisplay {
	defaultRendering {
		text.wrap = <span class=”text”>|</span>
	}
}

This would wrap a span tag with a “text” class around every text-type element rendered by Template Display.
Other examples
Example 1: defining the page title according to a field value, useful for a detail view. Make sure, "Display Controller (cached)" is defined. Otherwise, "substitutePageTitle" will have no effect.
plugin.tx_templatedisplay {
    substitutePageTitle = {title} - {field_custom}
}

Example 2: setting the pagebrowse parameters
plugin.tx_templatedisplay {
	pagebrowse {
		templateFile = fileadmin/templates/plugins/pagebrowse/template.html
		enableMorePages = 1
		enableLessPages = 1
		pagesBefore = 3
		pagesAfter = 3
	}
}

Developer's Guide
Hooks
Hooks offer an opportunity to step into the process at various points. They offer the possibility to manipulate data and influence the final output. Hooks can be used to replace personalized markers, introduced previously in the HTML template. There is a convention in templatedisplay to name Hook like ###HOOK.myHook###.
In templatedisplay, there are 2 available hooks:
preProcessResult (for pre-processing the HTML template)
postProcessResult (for post-processing the HTML content)
To facilitate the implementation of a hook, a skeleton file can be found in EXT:templatedisplay/samples/class.tx_templatedisplay_hook.php
Step 1
In the ext_localconf.php of your extension, register the Hook.
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTCONF']['templatedisplay']['postProcessResult']['myHook'][] = 'EXT:templatedisplay/class.tx_templatedisplay_hook.php:&tx_templatedisplay_hook';

Remarks: 
"postProcessResult" can be replaced by "preProcessResult".
"myHook" can be something else but must correspond to the marker ###HOOK.myHook###.
Make sure the path of the file is correct and suit your environment.
Don't forget to clear the configuration cache!!
Step 2
Write the PHP method that will transform the content.
class tx_templatedisplay_hook { 
	public function postProcessResult($content, $marker, &$pObj) {
		$controller = $pObj->getController();
	 	$data = $controller->cObj->data;
		if ($data['uid'] == 11399) { 		
			$_content = '';
			$content = str_replace('###HOOK.myHook###', $_content, $content);
		}
	 	return $content;
	}
}
Custom element types
It is possible to define custom element types. Such types will be added to the list of available types in the mapping interface, which makes them easier to use for users than the user-function type.
As for hooks this is a two-step process.
Step 1
Register the custom type in ext_localconf.php file of your extension. The syntax is as follows:
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTCONF']['templatedisplay']['types']['tx_test_mytype'] = array(
	'label'	=> 'LLL:EXT:' . $_EXTKEY . '/locallang.xml:mytype',
	'icon'	=> 'EXT:' . $_EXTKEY . '/mytype.png',
	'class'	=> 'tx_test_templatedisplay'
);

The custom type is registered with a specific key (e.g. “tx_test_mytype”) and with the following information:
a label that will appear in the drop-down list of available element types (as well as alt text for the icon)
an icon that will appear in the mapping interface when that type has been selected
a class to do the processing of that custom type. The class must implement the tx_templatedisplay_CustomType interface (more below).
You also need to include the class that will do the processing. As of TYPO3 4.3 you can register it with the autoloader instead (this is the preferred way).
Step 2
The method itself is expected to do the rendering. It receives the following parameters:
Parameter
Type
Description
$value
mixed
The current value of the field that was mapped.
$conf
array
TypoScript configuration for the rendering (this may be ignore if you don't need TypoScript).
$pObj
object 
A reference to the calling tx_templatedisplay object.

A sample implementation is provided in the “samples/class.tx_templatedisplay_phonetype.php” file. The code looks like this (without comments):
class tx_templatedisplay_PhoneType implements tx_templatedisplay_CustomType {
	function render($value, $conf, tx_templatedisplay $pObj) {
		$rendering = '<a href="callto://' . rawurlencode($value) . '">' . $value . '</a>';
		return $rendering;
	}
}

In this simple example the class just does some minor processing with the value it receives and returns the result.
As of TYPO3 4.3, it is recommended that such classes also implement the t3lib_Singleton interface so that only one instance of it is created (otherwise one instance is created for each field using this custom type on each pass in the loop). This will save memory.
Debugging
Debugging is provided in form of parameters added in the URL. A backend login is mandatory in order to see the output.

Name
Description
debug[structure]
Display the current data structure. Useful to see which data are given to templatedisplay.
debug[template]
Display the structure of the template. The template is cut in small pieces for processing according the LOOP and SUBLOOP.
debug[filter]
Display the active filter.
debug[markers]
Display the list of markers and their values.
debug[display]
Display the untranslated markers. By default, the production mode is active. It means when a translation does not succeed, the marker is erased from the final output. For debug purpose, it might be useful to identify these markers.
debug[pagebrowse]
Display the parameter that are transmitted to the pagebrowser. Extension pagebrowse is expected here.

Whenever the extension "devlog" is installed, it is also possible to monitor some information. In a templatedisplay record, check the following options as desired. It may be convenient, in (pre) production mode to check some information produced by visitor.
Known issues
Nested IF markers don't work
<--IF()-->
  ...
  <--IF()-->
    ...
  <!--ENDIF-->
  ...
<!--ENDIF-->
This feature seems to be obvious, but is quite difficult to implement, though (at least, with the actual code base). It comes from the way the template engine works and particularly the general use of regular expressions to handle the HTML. It would require a complex analysis of the template to cut up in right parts and supbarts the "IF" markers.
Experience has shown that it's possible to live without this feature. If the need of nested "IF" markers is required, you many want to have a look at the "phpdisplay" or "fluiddisplay" Data Consumers.
http://forge.typo3.org/issues/show/1954 
Multiple edition is not possible (module web > list)
This would require too much effort for very small benefit. The cases of multiple edition in templatedisplay are very rare.
